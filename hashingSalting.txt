Hashing --> is the process of converting your important data like passwd and convert it into a hexadecimal code
(32 characters in case of md5).

we have used md5 first which slightly older and then later we used bcrypt.
Bcrypt is slightly stronger hashing algo which uses salting to generate more complex hash.
